# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### 选择一种提交规范适配器（如 Angular 规范）

commitizen init cz-conventional-changelog --save --save-exact


### 添加CHANGELOG.md日志客户端

npm i -D conventional-changelog-cli@3

### 生成变更日志 

根据最近的 Git 提交记录生成日志（仅包含自上次 tag 后的变更）

npx conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md  -s

-p angular：指定使用 Angular 提交规范5
-i CHANGELOG.md ：指定输出文件
-s：覆盖原文件而非追加

-p angular：指定使用 Angular 提交规范5
-i CHANGELOG.md ：指定输出文件
-s：覆盖原文件而非追加
-r：1  

-r 表示生成 changelog 所需要使用的 release 版本数量，默认为1，全部则是0。


### 手动指定版本类型
// package.json
scripts: { 
	"release": "standard-version"
}

npm run release -- --release-as major  # 强制升级主版本
npm run release -- --release-as minor  # 强制升级次版本 
npm run release -- --release-as 2.1.0 # 指定具体版本
